# Head First! Character sheet

A simple online character sheet for yet another little TTRPG ruleset. 
The idea that sets this one apart from other ones is its two-staged approach, starting from base attributes that can then be improved for more specific skills. 

The character sheet may be customized by the gm to fit their needs: The localization, name and number of skills etc. can be set beforehand, by modifying a downloaded .json file and only sending the `set_by_gm` part back to the players. 

Right now, I'm hosting it [here](https://racopokemon.github.io/Head-First-Character-Sheet/), feel free to try it :)
